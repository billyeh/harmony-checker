Code created to check harmony rules, probably most useful to Music 49C students
at UC Berkeley.

Includes a web interface, which can be run with
```
python server.py
```
(or used and visited at the website above). Requires Music21 and flask to be installed.

and a command-line interface.
```
python harmony.py/__init__.py examplefile.xml
```
